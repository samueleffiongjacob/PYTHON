## CODE FORMATTER

autopep8 2.0.2: A tool that automatically formats Python code to conform to the PEP 8 style guide [SEE DOCUMENTATION](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/)

```bash
# Install  Autopep8
$ pip install --upgrade autopep8

# It checks when pycodestyle does not see
$ autopep8 --in-place pythonfile 

# it code remove and format some unnesary stuff on
$ autopep8 --in-place -a -a pythonfile
```

pycodestyle is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8. [SEE Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)

```bash
# To install PYCODESTYLE
$ pip install --upgrade pycodestyle

# check your Python code before pushing
$ pycodestyle  python file

# show the source code for each error and even the relevant text from PEP 8
$ pycodestyle --show-source --show-pep8  python file

# You can display how often each error was found:
$ pycodestyle --statistics -qq Python-2.5/Lib 
```

VS code  [see here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

```bash

# AUTO FORMATE with VS code

# Whenever you want to work with Python create vs code folder example below
$ .vscode

# Inside the folder create a setting.json file example below
$ settings.json

# Paste the below code inside your setting.json file

    {
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.autopep8"
    },
    "python. formatting.provider": "none"
}

```

## DEVELOPER TOOLS

[![SAMUEL EFFIONG SUBLIME IMAGE](/image/samuel%20effiong%20subline%20image.png)](https://www.sublimetext.com/)       [![SAMUEL EFFIONG VSCODE IMAGE](/image/samuel%20effiong%20vs%20code%20transparent%20%20150%20x%20150.png)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [![YOU RESIZE IMAGE HERE](/image/imageresizer.com.jpeg)](https://imageresizer.com/)

Browser Refresh for Sublime Text This plugin adds a keyboard shortcut to Sublime Text that will refresh the browser of your choice. Optionally the plugin can "auto save" your current file and bring the desired browser to the foreground. The default keyboard shortcuts are:
```âŒ˜ + Shift + R (Mac) Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows, Linux)```
